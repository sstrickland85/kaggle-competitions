# titanic-kaggle

Run with Python 3.7

1. titanic_eda.py when executed will import the train.csv and test.csv files. The script will 
concatenate the 2 csv files and begin the cleaning process. The output of this script will be 2 
csv files named train_clean.csv and test_clean.csv. These files are suitable for the modeling process.

2. titanic_built_in.py is a script that uses a built-in decision tree and logistic regression model.
The respective outputs are written to separate csv files. The accuracy was the same for both models.

4. I submitted the output to Kaggle and scored 0.73. My desire is to improve the data cleaning and
implement a random forest. My goal is a score of .80
